        <h2 class="glow-text outlined-text">Hi, I'm Yashas!</h2>
        <p>
        I’m Yashas Bhaskar Manjunatha, a results-driven Data Scientist with a passion for leveraging data to uncover insights, drive innovation, and solve complex real-world problems. With a Master of Science in Data Science from the University of Greenwich and a strong academic background in Electronics and Communication Engineering, I bring a multidisciplinary approach to data-driven problem solving. <br><br>

        My experience spans across data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, with a proven track record of building predictive models, deploying scalable data pipelines, and delivering analytical solutions that inform strategic business decisions. I’ve contributed to projects involving time series forecasting, deep learning (LSTM, CNN, GRU), and advanced statistical modeling, with applications in finance, healthcare, and gaming industry research. <br><br>

        Technically proficient in Python, R, SQL, and tools such as Power BI, Tableau, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn, I have built end-to-end solutions—from cleaning and engineering complex datasets to developing dashboards and deploying models using Flask and Streamlit. My professional experiences include working as a Data Analyst Trainee, AI Intern, and Machine Learning Intern, where I have automated reporting workflows, designed AI benchmarking frameworks, and enhanced model performance in practical applications.<br><br>

        Beyond technical skills, I pride myself on strong communication and collaboration abilities. I enjoy translating data into meaningful narratives for stakeholders and working within agile, cross-functional teams. I am particularly interested in the intersection of AI and business intelligence, and in building systems that not only predict but also explain, recommend, and optimize decisions at scale. <br><br>

        I am continuously exploring the evolving landscape of data science and AI, and I’m enthusiastic about applying these capabilities to solve high-impact challenges in dynamic environments.
